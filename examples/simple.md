# A simple markdown file

It contains simple markdown content.

## Like a title

And a paragraph with some **bold** and *italic* text

Also some code blocks:

```python
def foo():
    return "bar"
```

```bash
echo "Hello world!"
```

```json
{
    "foo": "bar"
}
```

```yaml
foo: bar
```

```toml
foo = "bar"
```

> Always end with an inspiring quote.
